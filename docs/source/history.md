# History

## v0.1.0-alpha

This is the initial release of **foxes** - ready for testing.

So far not many models have been transferred from the Fraunhofer IWES in-house predecessor *flappy*, they will be added in the following versions. Also optimization is not yet included. We are just getting started here!

Enjoy - we are awaiting comments and issues, thanks for testing.

## v0.1.1-alpha

- New code style, created by *black*
- Small fixes, discovered by *flake8*
- Tests now via *pytest* instead of *unittest*

**Full Changelog**: [](https://github.com/FraunhoferIWES/foxes/commits/v0.1.3)

## v0.1.4-alpha

- Fixes
  - Static data: Adding missing data `wind_rotation.nc` to manifest
- Models
  - New wake model added: `TurbOParkWake` from Orsted
  - New turbine type added: `PCtSingleFiles`, reads power and thrust curves from two separate files
  - New turbulence intensity wake model added: `IECTI2019`/`Frandsen` and `IECTI2005`

## v0.2.0-alpha

- Core
  - Introducing the concept of runners
- Opt
  - New sub package: `foxes.opt`, install by `pip install foxes[opt]`. This introduces the capability to run wind farm optimizations. As examples layout optimization for simple cases are given, see below.
- Models
  - New turbine model: `Thrust2Ct`, calculates ct from thrust values
  - New turbine type: `NullType`, a turbine type with only rotor diameter and hub height data
  - Renamed `PCtSingleFiles` into `PCtTwoFiles`
- Output
  - New output: `WindRoseOutput`, providing a plotly figure that shows a rose-type histogram
  - New output: `AmbientWindRoseOutput`, providing rose-type plotly figures of ambient data (no wake calculation involved)
- Algorithms
  - Improved `Downwind`: Now with option for ambient runs (no wakes)
- Utils
  - New utility: `show_plotly_fig`, opens a window that shows a plotly figure (instead of browser)
  - New runners: `DefaultRunner`, `DaskRunner`. The latter features parallel runs via dask
- Examples
  - Introducing two sub-folders of examples: `foxes` and `foxes.opt`
  - New example: `wind_rose`, calculation of wind rose states data
  - New example: `layout_single_state`, wind farm layout optimization for a single wind state
  - New example: `layout_wind_rose`, wind farm layout optimization for wind rose states
- Notebooks
  - New notebook: `layout_opt.ipynb`, demonstrating a simple layout optimization case
